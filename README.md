- 🧠 **React + TypeScript (TSX)** — Type-safe and component-based
- 🎨 **CSS** — Overused styles
- 📁 **File-based structure** — Easy to extend and customize
- 🧾 **Apache 2.0 License** — Use it personally or commercially, with attribution

## 🧑‍💻 Customize Your Site

### This site is yours! Start by editing:

src/pages/ — Your main pages

src/add/ — Navbar, footer, sections

src/add/media — Your images, files

src/add/css/ — Add your own CSS/SCSS

You can easily expand the project with blog posts (I used blogger.com iframe), photo galleries, or additional sections. The modular structure makes it simple.
